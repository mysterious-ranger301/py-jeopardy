# py-jeopardy
A fully customizeable Jeopardy game made with Python and PyQt5

# Setup
I assume you have Python installed, but if not, go to https://python.org and download Python.
During the installation process, make sure to check the "Add Python to PATH" checkbox to make things easier.

Anyways, we need some libraries in order to run this app. Open a Terminal (or command prompt, if you will :)
and type in _pip install PyQt5_. This will install PyQt5 for our program to use. If you're on Linux,
instead of _pip_ make sure to type in _pip3_.
That's it for libraries, now to customization.
